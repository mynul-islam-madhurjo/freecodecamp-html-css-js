 # We can not put anything in the self closing tags.
 # HTML tags are not case sensitive
 # Ignores white spaces
 # We have two attributes global and element specific attribute.
 # Global attributes can be accessed from anywhere unlike element specific like width in the img

 DOM
 # Not a framework not a programming language exists within browser it is an API for HTML
 # Api is an user manuel that helps in giving functionalities to devs without the need of knowing
 the technology behind it
 # Api the dom manipulates the html without knocking how html is being manipulated
 # when we do something on the browser we actually connect to  the dom then call object
 like window or document and do stuffs like reload, new tab open, maximize minimize
 # We can store item in localStorage which saves data in browser temporarily
